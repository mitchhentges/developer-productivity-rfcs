# developer-productivity-rfcs

Developer Productivity team planning

* [Issues](https://github.com/mozilla-conduit/developer-productivity-rfcs/issues) are generally used to identify a potential goal and solution, or to enlist help in drafting an RFC.
* [pull requests](https://github.com/mozilla-conduit/developer-productivity-rfcs/pulls) contain drafts and proposed RFCs; and
* [the repo](rfcs/) holds RFCs on which we have been fully decided on.

## Background

**What**: Ideas and projects of the Developer Productivity Team, in one discoverable place.

**Why**: This repo serves as a place to coordinate design and architecture, so that everyone can participate and past discussions are accessible to everyone.

**How**: See [mechanics](mechanics.md) for more details. heavily influenced and copied from [releng-rfcs](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/releng-rfcs)

Similar to the releng-rfc repo, RFCs are preferably for fleshing out details of a proposal that have already been discussed on some level and are expected to succeed. For ideas or problems that still need to reach a a core level of consensus in their broad strokes, a more open ended discussion (starting from the problem statements, then collaboratively reaching a solution) may be more productive.
